## Random.org

A very simple Rust library for [random.org](https://www.random.org).

#### Note:
This is a project for me to learn Rust, so a lot of stuff is missing and this is definitely alpha quality.

### Implemented Random Functions
 - `generateIntegers`
 - `generateStrings`
 - `generateGaussians`
 - `generateUUIDs`

### Examples
Please look in the `examples` directory
